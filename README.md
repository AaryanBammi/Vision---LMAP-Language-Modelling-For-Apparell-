# Vision–LMAP: Language Modelling for Apparel

## Overview
Vision–LMAP is a vision‑language engine that transforms any shopper prompt into a curated outfit carousel with SEO‑ready captions. It is designed as a plug‑and‑play module for e‑commerce platforms: ask for “a summer brunch look” and instantly surface matching garments, descriptions and styling tips.

## Components
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Demographic breakdowns, seasonality and usage patterns; visual insights across gender, product category and season.
2. **Product Description Generator:** Cleans and tokenises SKU metadata, extracts image embeddings via VGG16 and BLIP, and trains a sequence‑to‑sequence language model tuned using random/halving search with BLEU score evaluation.
3. **Outfit Recommender:** Builds an embedding graph where nodes represent product vectors; uses cosine similarity to link items and map shopper queries to the nearest nodes; returns the top‑k matching outfits with generated captions.
4. **Inference & Evaluation:** Includes a Jupyter demo that generates captions and outfit carousels in real time. Evaluation includes BLEU scores and business‑oriented metrics (engagement, click‑through rates).

## Business Impact
- **Faster merchandising:** Automatically generate on‑brand descriptions and update catalogues.
- **Higher engagement:** Personalised outfit suggestions increase dwell time and conversion.
- **SEO boost:** Optimised captions improve search rankings and discoverability.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook vision_lmap_apparel_language_model.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook for data preparation, model training and inference.

## Next Steps
- Incorporate vision transformers to improve image encoding.
- Introduce context‑aware graph rewiring for smarter outfit recommendations.
- Conduct live A/B tests to refine carousel layouts and caption styles.
