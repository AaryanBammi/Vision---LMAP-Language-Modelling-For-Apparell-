üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Demographic breakdowns, seasonality, usage patterns
	‚Ä¢	Visual insights: distributions by gender, category, season

2. Product Description Generator
	‚Ä¢	Metadata ‚Üí Text: Cleans & tokenizes SKU data
	‚Ä¢	Image Encoder: VGG16 embeddings + BLIP for visual context
	‚Ä¢	Seq2Seq Model: Tuned via randomized/halving search; evaluated with BLEU

3. Outfit Recommender
	‚Ä¢	Embedding Graph: Cosine-similarity links between product vectors
	‚Ä¢	Query Mapping: Translates shopper prompt ‚Üí nearest graph nodes
	‚Ä¢	Carousel Output: Top-k matching outfits + generated captions

4. Inference & Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter demo: real-time caption generation & carousel rendering
	‚Ä¢	BLEU scores & business-metric analysis
